                <div class="ans">This code implements the Sorting algorithm but it sort the number digit by digit. Using
                    countSort in which firstly the maintask function was called by providing the array and the value of
                    "n".
                    Now,inside maintask getMax function was called to get the maximum value and it is stored in max
                    variable.<br>
                    Inside a loop the countSort function was called to sort the array and finally the sorted array is
                    printed.<br>

                    And in the end we'll see the numbers get sorted.

                        <li>It is not an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning that it requires additional memory to
                            perform the sort.</li>
                        <li>It can be slower than other sorting algorithms for small sets of data.</li>
                        <li>It is not suitable for sorting data that is already partially sorted.</li>
